# Project:  "Mesto" (Place)

## Created as one of the [Yandex.Praktikum](https://praktikum.yandex.com/) Bootcamp projects

[Github Pages](https://belka-mironova.github.io/mesto/)

**Description**

"Mesto" is an interactive page where users can share their photos. Users have options to edit their profile, like cards and delete photos if they changed their mind :)
In this work I've used the advanced features of HTML and CSS, vanilla JavaScript (asynchronous JS, OOP, DOM API etc), Webpack.
